MyBackup is a PHP class for backing up MySQL databases
and tables. Like the CLI-command "mysqladmin". Format of
backup is fully compatible with CLI-command "mysql" and
you could use MyBackup for your MySQL-backups if you
don't want to depend on PHP-function system() to use 
"mysqladmin"

!!PLEASE NOTE!! This class is in an early beta and should
probably be tested in development environment first.

Example of usage:

= Connecting to your database server
$mb = new MyBackup('DB_HOST', 'DB_USER', 'DB_PASS', 'DB_DATABASE');
$mb->database_connect();

= Selecting tables to dump, of none we will dump all tables in
= that database. You can select by comma seperate or using an array
$mb->tables_prepare('wp_1_comments,wp_2_comments,wp_3_comments');

= or..
$mb->tables_prepare( array('wp_1_comments', 'wp_2_comments', 'wp_3_comments') );

= If you want to see what tables we have selected, just:
$mb->tables_print();

= Perform the actual database dump
$data = $mb->database_backup();

= (Working on writing dump to file at the moment. Soon!)

= Print what we've dumped
print $data;


Release early, release often!
